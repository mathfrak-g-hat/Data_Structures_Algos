    "## 1) Graphs as a mathematical structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This part is based on [GTG13, Sec.14.1]. We start with the vocabulary of graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.a - Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **graph** is a couple of sets $G=(V,E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices, and where $E$ is the collection of edges $(u,v)$ connecting two vertices $u,v\\in V$.\n",
    "- If all edges in a graph are directed according to a (partial) order relation on $V$, we say that $G$ is a **directed graph** or a **digraph**. When all edges are undirected, $G$ is called an **undirected**, and if some edges are directed, we say that it's a **mixed graph**.\n",
    "- If there is a weight attached to each edge in $E$, then $G$ is called a **weighted graph**.\n",
    "- If $(u,v)\\in E$ is an edge, $u$ is called the **origin** and $v$ is called the **destination** of the edge. When $u,v\\in V$ are connected by an edge $(u,v)\\in E$, we say that these vertices are **adjacent**.\n",
    "- The **outgoing** edges of a vertex $u\\in V$ are the edges $\\alpha \\in E$ whose origin is $u$. Similarly, the **incoming** edges of $u\\in V$ are the $\\beta \\in E$ having $u$ as a destination. An edge $e\\in E$ is said to be **incident** to a vertex $u\\in V$ if $v$ is one of the endpoints of $e$.\n",
    "- The **degree** $deg(u)$ of a vertex $u\\in V$ is the number of incident edges to $u$. Respectively, the number of incoming and outgoing edges to $u\\in V$ are the **in-degree** and **out-degree**, denoted by $indeg(u)$ and $outdeg(u)$.\n",
    "- A graph $G=(V,E)$ is said to be **simple** if there are no parallel edges between the same vertices, and if there are no self-loops (i.e. edges connecting a vertex to itself).\n",
    "- A **path** is a sequence of alternating vertices and edges $(v_1,e_1,v_2,e_2,\\cdots,v_n)$ such that each $e_i\\in E$ is incident to both $v_i,v_{i+1}\\in V$. When all edges in a path are directed, we say that the path is directed.\n",
    "- A path that starts and end at the same vertex $v_1=v_n$ is called a **cycle**. When all vertices of a cycle other than the origin are distinct, we say that the cycle is **simple**. A graph that contains no cycles is said to be **acyclic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comments:\n",
    "1) Here, it's important to underline that we described the edges $E$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ as a collection and not as a set. This is to allow several edges connecting two vertices. In the case where $G$ is simple, $E$ is indeed a well-defined set.\n",
    "2) Unless otherwise stated, [GTG13] restrict to simple graphs in chapter 14.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next terms are discussed after Example 14.6 of [GTG13]. Suppose $G = (V,E)$ is a graph.\n",
    "* Given two vertices $u,v \\in V$, we say that $v$ is **reachable** from $u$ if there exists a path in $G$ that connects these two vertices. In the case where $G$ is directed, reachability requires the existence of a directed path, meaning that this is not a symmetric relation in general. For undirected graphs however, reachability is symmetric.\n",
    "* The graph $G$ is said to be **connected** if for any vertices $u,v\\in V$ there exists a path from $u$ to $v$.\n",
    "* A directed graph is **strongly connected** if for any vertices $u,v\\in V$, $v$ is reachable from $u$ and $u$ is reachable from $v$.\n",
    "* A **subgraph** $H=(V_H, E_H)$ of $G$ is a graph such that $V_H\\subseteq V$ and $E_H\\subseteq E$. A **spanning subgraph** $H$ of $G$ is a subgraph that contains all the vertices of $G$.\n",
    "* If a graph is not connected, its maximal connected subgraphs are called **connected components**.\n",
    "* A **forest** is a graph without cycles. A connected forest is called a **tree**.\n",
    "* A **spanning tree** $T $of a graph $G$ is a connected, spanning, acyclic subgraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in these last definitions, the trees are slightly different from the ones previously seen, as there are no designated root.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.b - Some graph properties\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sequel, we assume that $G$ is a simple graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proposition 14.8\n",
    "If $G = (V,E)$ has $m$ edges, then: \n",
    "$$\\sum_{v\\in V}deg(v) = 2m.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof:\n",
    "For every $v\\in V$, write:\n",
    "$$O_v = \\{e\\in E \\ |\\ e = (v,w), w\\in V\\},$$\n",
    "$$D_v = \\{e\\in E \\ |\\ e = (u,v), u\\in V\\},$$\n",
    "and allowing these subsets to be empty. Notice then that $E = \\sqcup_{v\\in V}O_v = \\sqcup_{v\\in V}D_v$, so that:\n",
    "$$m = \\mathrm{card}(E) = \\sum_{v\\in V}\\mathrm{card}(O_v)= \\sum_{v\\in V}\\mathrm{card}(D_v).$$\n",
    "Since by definition $deg(v)=\\mathrm{card}(O_v)+\\mathrm{card}(D_v)$, summing the latter yields:\n",
    "$$\\sum_{v\\in V}deg(v) = 2\\mathrm{card}(E)=2m.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proposition 14.9\n",
    "If $G = (V,E)$ is directed with $m$ edges, then: \n",
    "$$ \\sum_{v\\in V}indeg(v) = \\sum_{v\\in V}outdeg(v) = m.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof:\n",
    "Using the notation of the previous proof, we have by definition that $indeg(v)=\\mathrm{card}(O_v)$ and $indeg(v)=\\mathrm{card}(D_v)$. The result follows by summing over the vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proposition 14.10\n",
    "If $G = (V,E)$ is simple and has $m$ edges and $n$ vertices, then:\n",
    "- If $G$ is directed then $m\\le n(n-1)$.\n",
    "- If $G$ is undirected then $m\\le n(n-1)/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof:\n",
    "Given $G=(V,E)$, we can complete it to a connected graph $\\tilde{G}=(V,\\tilde{E})$ by adding edges connecting each $v\\in V$ to all other $w\\in V\\smallsetminus\\{v\\}$. In this case, we'll obviously have $m\\le \\mathrm{card}(\\tilde{E})$, with $\\mathrm{card}(\\tilde{E})$ being the **highest upper-bound possible** for $\\mathrm{card}(E)$. Now, there are two cases:\n",
    "- If $G$ is simple and undirected, then for all $v\\in V$ and $w\\in V\\smallsetminus\\{v\\}$, we have $(v,w)=(w,v)\\in \\tilde{E}$. Next, summing the number of edges **not counted yet** for each vertex in $V$, we have:\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{card}(\\tilde{E})=\\sum_{i=1}^n(n-i)=\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} j = n(n-1)/2.$$\n",
    "- If $G$ is simple and directed, then for all $v\\in V$ and $w\\in V\\smallsetminus\\{v\\}$, we have $(v,w)\\ne (w,v)\\in \\tilde{E}$. As such, the cardinality of $\\tilde{E}$ for a directed $G$ is twice that of the undirected case.\n",

    "## 2) Implementations of graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.a - Implementation as an adjacency list\n",
    "\n",
    "This part follows lecture 155 of Portilla's course. Link to notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/jmportilla/Python-for-Algorithms--Data-Structures--and-Interviews/tree/master/08-Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point of this section is the adjacency matrix associated to a (weighted) graph. This notion is dicussed in Lecture 154. For graphs with small numbers of vertices and/or edges, the adjacency matrix is rather sparse, meaning that it is not a convenient structure for the implementation of small graphs. This issue can be resolved by resorting to **adjacency lists**, which store each vertex of the graph, and assign a dictionary to each vertex to store the connections with other vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent a graph then, we will create two classes:\n",
    "1) The *Vertex* class, which will represent the individual vertices of the graph, and store a dictionary whose keys are the other vertices to which it is connected, and whose values are the weights of the resulting edges. So if *Vertex* represents some $v\\in V$ for a given $G=(V,E)$, then the object representing $v$ stores the subsets $O_v$ and $D_v$ of the previous section.\n",
    "2) The *Graph* class, which represents the graph $G$. Since $E$ is essentially represented by the vertices, the *Graph* object will just keep a master list of vertices (the adjacency list) representing $V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the interface of the *Vertex* class, we want the following attributes:\n",
    "* **id**: The string storing the name of the vertex.\n",
    "* **connectedTo:** The dictionary of weighted edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the methods of *Vertex*, we'll implement:\n",
    "* **getId()**: Returns ID of current vertex.\n",
    "* **__ str __()**: Overloading of the *str* function to display the *connectedTo* contents.\n",
    "* **addNeighbor(vertex)**: To add a connection from current vertex to another. \n",
    "* **getConnections()**: Which returns all of the vertices in the adjacency list, as represented by the connectedTo instance variable. \n",
    "* **getWeight(vertex)**: Which returns the weight of the edge from this vertex to the vertex passed as a parameter.\n",

    "\n",
    "The knight tour problem is described as follows:\n",
    "- We have a chess board (8x8) on which there is only the knight at one of the corners.\n",
    "- We want to visit each square of the board exactly once. Here, it's important to note that the knight can only move either by 2 squares vertically then 1 horizontally, or two squares vertically and then 1 horizontally. By \"visiting\" a square, we mean the square reached by at the end of the move, and we don't count the squares *during* the move.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem can be solved by a **depth first** graph traversal. The idea is to model all the squares of the graph as vertices, with edges corresponding to admissible knight moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In rough terms, starting from a given square on the board, depth first traversal builds an exploration tree whose root is the initial square, and the children of the root are the squares that can be reached in one move. Continuing this process recursively, depth first search first explores how deep the path in the tree could be (or how long it could be in the graph), and backtracks if the last vertex reached is a dead end. Unlike breadth first search, it is a recursive algorithm, and generalizes the inorder, preorder and postorder traversals studied for binary trees.\n",
