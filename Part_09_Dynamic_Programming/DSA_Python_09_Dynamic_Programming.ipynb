    "1) Of course, this is not applicable in every setting, because as in optimal control, there needs to be a \"principle of optimality\": the main problem should be able to be formulated in such a way that the subproblems have a well-defined optimal solution.\n",

    "### 1.a - Problem formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "A company cuts steel rods and sells the parts obtained at various prices. The company has a table of prices $p_i$ (in dollars) as a function of the length $i=1,2,\\cdots,n,\\cdots$ (in inches) of the rod. Given a rod of length $n$, what is the optimal revenue $r_n$ that can be achieved by cutting the rod into smaller pieces and selling them?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of concreteness, suppose we have the following table of prices:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Length i (in)  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |\n",
    "        ---------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "        Price ($)      | 1 | 5 | 8 | 9 | 10| 17| 17| 20| 24| 30 |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.b - Preliminaries and naive solution\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will consider that cutting the rod corresponds to choosing the lengths $i_j$ starting from the left at which we perform cuts. The resulting ways of cutting will not be distinct, but we address this issue later. There are $(n-1)$ cutting positions to choose, and summing over the total number of cuts $j$ to make we have:\n",

    "$$\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}C_j^{n-1}=2^{n-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "ways of cutting a rod of length $n$. An important observation here is that the rod cutting problem exhibits **optimal substructure**, since the maximal revenue $r_n$ of cutting a rod of length $n$ depends on the maximal revenue $r_{n-k}$ of cutting a rod of length $(n-k)$, with $k=0,\\cdots, n$. In fact continuing with the notation of the previous section, it is easy to see that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_n = \\max_{k=0,\\cdots,n-1}\\{p_k+r_{n-k}\\}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this last formula, we can readily solve the rod-cutting problem with the following top-down "

Therefore, we expect the *cut_rod()* algorithm to run in exponential time $O(2^n)$.\n",

Assuming that computing the product of two matrices $A\\in\\mathbb{M}_{p\\times q}$ and $B\\in\\mathbb{M}_{q\\times r}$ costs $p\\cdot q\\cdot r$ scalar multiplications, what is the parenthetization of the product $\\prod_{i=1}^n A_i$ that minimizes the number of scalar multiplications?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "To illustrate why this is an important question, suppose $A_1\\in \\mathbb{M}_{10\\times 100}$, $A_2\\in \\mathbb{M}_{100\\times 5}$, and $A_3\\in \\mathbb{M}_{5\\times 50}$. Let's count the total number of scalar multiplications for each parenthesization:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) $((A_1A_2)A_3)$: Computing $(A_1A_2)$ will involve $5000$ multiplications, and then multiplying by $A_3$ will involve $2500$ multiplications, so the total number of multiplications for this parenthetization is $7500$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Thus, choosing the correct parenthesization reduces the number of scalar multiplications by $90\\%$ in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an idea of the complexity of this problem, it could be useful to first find the number of possible parenthesizations. By induction, one can show that for $n$ matrices, there are $C_n$ parenthesizations, where the latter denotes the $n$-th Catalan number, where $C_1=1$ and\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}C_k\\cdot C_{n-k},\\ \\ \\forall n\\ge 2.$$\n",

    "This grows as $\\Omega(4^n/n^{3/2})$, meaning that checking all possible parenthesizations to find the minimum is essentially unfeasible.\n",

    "* $(A_1A_2A_3A_4)A_5$\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of the cases above, we first find the optimal parenthesization of the shorter chains (of length 3 and 4), and then we take the minimum over the 4 numbers obtained. To formalize this idea, suppose $1\\le i\\le j \\le 5$, and let $m(i,j)$ denote the **minimal total number of multiplications** over all parenthesizations of $A_iA_{i+1}\\cdots A_j$. We then have $m(i,j)=0$ if $i=j$, and from the above:\n",

    "In other words, this recursive expression gives us the optimal substructure for this problem.\n",

    "## 3) Dynamic Programming in general\n",
    "\n",
    "This part is based on [CLRS22, Sec.14.3]. To be able to solve a problem using dynamic programming, there are essentially two ingredients that have to be present: An optimal substructure, and overlapping subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In view of the other algorithms studied up to this point, it is useful to view dynamic programming as a form of divide-and-conquer procedure used when we have overlapping problems and optimal substructure. Very often also, dynamic programming is more easily implemented using recursions, which leads us to the discussion of memoization and/or bottom-up approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.a - Optimal substructure\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of the previously treated problems, we constructed a final solution based on optimal solutions to subproblems. The pattern we used is the following:\n",
    "1) We make an initial initial choice, which gives rise to a \"subproblem\", by which we mean solving the same problem but \"lower dimension\" or less parameters. (E.g., a shorter input array, or a lower value of an amount).\n",
    "2) For a given problem, we assume that we are given the choice leading to an optimal solution. At this step we do not determine it.\n",
    "3) Given an optimal choice, we determine the ensuing subproblems, and characterize their \"structure\".\n",
    "4) We show that the solutions to the subproblems used within an optimal solution must themselves be optimal, essentially checking a principle of optimality.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways in which optimal substructure varies accross problems: (1) How many subproblems an optimal solution to the problem uses, and (2) how many choices need to be made to determine the subproblems solved. Both of these will determine the running time of the function that solves the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, when we are looking for optimal substructure, we are essentially doing the divide-and-conquer part of this class of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.b - Overlapping subproblems\n",
    "\n",
    "For dynamic programming to be applicable, the top-down recursive approach should inevitably lead to the same subproblems being solved, exactly as in the case of the number factor problem. In the case of more general divide-and-conquer algorithms, the subproblems generated by the \"divide\" part will essentially always be new, in which case dynamic programming is not applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that we have overlapping subproblems, the \"programming\" part of dynamic programming essentially means that we memorize the subproblems once we solve them, and by re-using the solutions, we greatly improve the execution time of the implemented function. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a top-down implementation, keeping an array of results is called **memoization**. This array is checked at each recursive call, and typically for these implementations, some care needs to be taken in the initialization of the array and how the existence of a given entry is checked.\n",
    "\n",
    "For bottom-up implementations, we always start by solving the subproblems and storing the optimal value. Of course, this means that we keep an array which is filled with solutions to base cases, and then build the solutions of the larger problems piece-by-piece. Here, when looking for a min or a max, it's useful to keep in mind that we often use an additional loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.c - Top-down vs bottom-up\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches have pros and cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Top-down approaches are slightly easier to implement once we understand how the optimal substructure works. In this case, the solution algorithm is recursive. The issue is that we need to be careful with the memoization, and to keep in mind that quite often, these algorithms are less efficient in terms of execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Bottom-up approaches could be quite more efficient than bottom-down recursions, but they could be harder to implement. When building a bottom-up solution, we need to know more than the recursive properties of the solutions, which could be non-trivial in some cases.\n"
