    "**References:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chapter 8 of \"Data structures and algorithms in Python\", by Goodrich, Tamassia and Goldwasser (primary, abbreviated [GTG13]). \n",
    "- Section 16 of \"Python for Data Structures, Algorithms, and Interviews!\" by Jose Portilla.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comments:**\n",
    "- Section 16 of Portilla also discusses priority queues and heaps. These data structures are discussed in chapter 9 of [GTG13].\n",
    "- Chapter 8 of [GTG13] is not the only one discussing trees. Related data structures are also discussed in chapters 9 (priority queues) and 11 (search trees).\n",
    "- Recursion is relevant here when performing some operations on trees.\n",
    "- The core of this chapter are the traversal algorithms (preordered, inordered and postordered).\n",
    "- The material on arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues, form the building blocks for the advanced data structures which are trees, hash tables and graphs. The latter are used to build appropriate containers for data, which we eventually want to sort and search through. The more algorithmic material (algorithm analysis and recursion) are building blocks for the effective design of sorting and searching algorithms.\n",
    "- The main feature of trees is the hierarchy between its elements. In mathematical terms, this data structure imposes a partial ordering on its elements. This hierarchy seems to be the main reason why trees are at the basis of many efficient search algorithms."

    "## 1) Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Ref: Sections 8.1 and 8.2 of [GTG13], and some definitions from section 8.4.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.a - General trees\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition: \n",
    "A **tree** $T$ is a set of nodes with a parent-child relationship satisfying the following properties:\n",
    "- If $T\\ne \\emptyset$, there exists an element $\\rho\\in T$ that has no parent, called the **root** of $T$.\n",
    "- For every node $\\nu \\in T\\smallsetminus\\{\\rho\\}$, there exists a unique $\\alpha \\in T\\smallsetminus\\{\\nu\\}$ called the **parent** of $\\nu$.\n",
    "- Given $\\nu,\\alpha \\in T$, a node $\\alpha\\in T$ is called a child of $\\nu$ if $\\nu$ is the parent of $\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of this definition, there are several other terms used to discuss trees:\n",
    "- **Node:** An element of a tree, typically consisting of a key and a payload.\n",
    "- **Edge:** A segment connecting two nodes with a parent/child relation, denoted $(\\nu,\\mu)$. Every note other than the root has precisely one incoming edge from its parent, and one outgoing edge for each of its children.\n",
    "- **Silbings:** If $\\alpha,\\beta \\in T$ are both children of $\\nu\\in T$, we say that they are siblings.\n",
    "- **Internal nodes:** A node $\\nu \\in T$ is internal if it has at least one child.\n",
    "- **Leaves:** Nodes that do not have children (opposite of internal), also called external nodes.\n",
    "- **Path:** A sequence of nodes such that every two consecutive nodes form an edge. \n",
    "- **Ancestors and descendants:** $\\nu$ is an ancestor of $\\alpha$ (the descendant) if there exists a path in $T$ starting  $\\nu$ and ending at $\\alpha$.\n",
    "- **Subtree:** A subtree $T'\\subseteq T$ rooted at $\\nu\\in T$ is a tree whose root is $\\nu$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ã€ priori, the children of a given node do not have an order. When we impose an order on the children, we say that $T$ is an **ordered tree**. A visual example of an ordered tree would be the (sub) sections of a book, where the nodes of such a tree would be the the chapters, sections, subsections and the \"book\" node which would be the root. An example of an unordered tree would be the set (sub)directories on an HDD (if we do not order the nodes by size or date of modification).\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree data structure also admits a recursive definition: A tree $T$ is either empty, or consists of a root and zero or more subtrees, each of which is also a tree. The root of each subtree is connected to the root of the parent tree by an edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next two notions we introduce quantify the \"hierarchy\" in the data modelled by a tree:\n",
    "- **Depth and level:** Suppose $\\nu\\in T$ is a node. The depth of $\\nu$ is the number of its ancestors starting from the root. The set of all nodes having depth $d$ is called the level $d$ of $T$.\n",
    "- **Height of a node:** The height of a node $\\nu\\in T$ is defined recursively. If $\\nu$ is a leaf, then its height is $0$; and if $\\nu$ is an internal node, it is one plus the maximum height of its children. (Note the max, because not all children have descendants of the same depth.)\n",
    "- **Height of a tree:** The height of a tree is the height of its root node. Equivalently, the height of an non-empty $T$ is the maximum depth of its leaf nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The height and depth of a node will later be implemented as methods. See section 8.1 of [GTG13] for more details."

    "\n",
    "This part is based on section 8.2. \n",

    "#### Definition:\n",
    "A **binary tree** (or B-tree) is an ordered tree $T$ satisfying the following properties:\n",
    "- Every node has at most two children.\n",
    "- Each child is either a **left child** or a **right child**.\n",
    "- The left child precedes the right one.\n",
    "The left or right subtree of an internal node $\\nu$ is the subtree rooted at the left or right child respectively. If each node of a B-tree $T$ either has 0 or 2 children, we say that $T$ is a **proper (or full)** binary tree.\n",

    "### 1.c - Tree traversal algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we cover only the basics of section 8.4 (8.4.1-8.4.3), and discuss the implementation of traversal algorithms in section 3 of this notebook. Another part we skip in this subsection is the discussion in 8.4.5, which deals with applications of tree traversals.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **traversal** of a tree $T$ is a systematic way of visiting all the nodes of a tree. Depending on the type of data stored in a tree, traversals can be used for any manner of operations, ranging from incrementation of indices to performing complex computations. In the sequel, we discuss 4 types of tree traversals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1 - Preorder traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "In a preorder traversal of a *general* tree $T$, we recursively visit a node $\\nu$ and then the subtrees of that node (i.e. the subtrees rooted at the children of $\\nu$). By a \"visit\", we mean performing a given action dictated by an application (e.g. checking equality for a search). The pseudocode of a preorder traversal is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Algorithm preorder(T,p):\n",
    "            \n",
    "            Perform the visit action at p\n",
    "            \n",
    "            for c in T.children(p):\n",
    "                preorder(T,C)\n",
    "                \n",
    "#### 2 - Postorder traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "In a postorder traversal, we perform the visit action on a given $\\nu \\in T$ after having performed it over its subtrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Algorithm postorder(T,p):\n",
    "            \n",
    "            for c in T.children(p):\n",
    "                preorder(T,C)\n",
    "            \n",
    "            Perform the visit action at p\n",
    "\n",
    "See end of 8.4.1 for the running time analysis of pre/post-order traversals. Note that in these two algorithms, we are essentially visiting the nodes vertically then horizontally.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3 - Breadth-first traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre- and postorder traversals essentially perform their visits from the root to the leaves. Alternatively, we may want to visit all nodes according to their depth, before moving to a higher depth (i.e. horizontally then vertically). For the pseudocode of this traversal, [GTG13] rely on queues:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Algorithm breadth_first(T):\n",
    "            \n",
    "            Init queue Q to contain T.root()\n",
    "            \n",
    "            while not Q.is_empty():\n",
    "                # Get oldest entry in Q\n",
    "                p = Q.dequeue()\n",
    "                Perform the visit action for p\n",
    "                for c in T.children(p):\n",
    "                    # Add p's children to end of Q for later visits\n",
    "                    Q.enqueue(c)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the pre/postorder traversals, breadth-first traversal is not recursive. If $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree, and if the visit action is $O(1)$, then the breadth-first traversal has $O(n)$ complexity (see sec. 8.4.2).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4 - Inorder traversal of a binary tree\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is specialized to binary trees, and consists informally of visiting the tree from left to right, as we visit the left subtree of $\\nu$, then visit $\\nu$, and then visit the right subtree of $\\nu \\in T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Algorithm inorder(p):\n",
    "            if p.lc() != None:\n",
    "                inorder(p.lc())\n",
    "            Perform visit action at p.\n",
    "            if p.rc() != None:\n",
    "                inorder(p.rc())\n",
    "                \n",
    "As an application of inorder traversal, [GTG13] give an example with binary search trees at the end of section 8.4.3.\n"

    "## 3) Some properties of binary trees\n",
    "\n",
    "We record two propositions from section 8.2.2. First, it is also useful to know the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proposition 8.4:\n",
    "The height of a non-empty tree is equal to the maximum depth of its leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof sketch:\n",
    "This is proved by induction on the *maximal depth* of the leaves of $T$, and the cases of height $1$ and $2$ are easy to see. For the induction step, unwinding the definitions yields that the height of a tree is equal to $1$ plus the maximal height of the subtrees rooted at the children of the root of $T$. This fact proves the induction step for the statement of the proposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "QED\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proposition 8.8:\n",
    "Let $T$ be a non-empty binary tree, and let $n$, $n_E$, $n_I$ and $h$ denote the numbers of nodes, external nodes, internal nodes and height of $T$ respectively. The $T$ has the following properties:\n",
    "1) $h+1\\le n\\le 2^{h+1}-1.$\n",
    "2) $1\\le n_E\\le 2^h .$\n",
    "3) $h\\le n_I\\le 2^h -1.$\n",
    "4) $\\log(n+1)-1\\le h \\le n-1.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, if $T$ is proper, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "5) $2h+1\\le n\\le 2^{h+1}-1.$\n",
    "6) $h+1\\le n_E\\le 2^h .$\n",
    "7) $h\\le n_I\\le 2^h -1.$\n",
    "8) $\\log(n+1)-1\\le h \\le (n-1)/2.$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof sketch\n",
    "1) If a binary tree $T$ has $n$ nodes and has height $h$, then the tree must contain at least the leaf of maximal depth and its $h$ ancestors, so that $n\\ge h+1$. If $T$ is full/proper, then level $i=0,\\cdots,h$ must contain $2^i$ nodes, meaning that $n=\\sum_{i=0}^h2^i=2^{h+1}-1$. The latter is the maximal number of nodes possible for $T$, which proves the second inequality.\n",
    "2) $n_E$ is the number of leaves. If $T$ is non-empty and has height $h$, the minimal number of leaves is achieved if there is exactly one leaf and each of the $h$ ancestors has precisely one child. The inequality $n_E\\le 2^h$ follows from the fact that $2^h$ is the maximal number of leaves (for a full $T$), which is the maximal possible number of nodes at level $h$ (the root has level $0$).\n",
    "3) If $T$ has height $h$, then the leaf of maximal depth must have at least $h$ ancestors which are interior nodes. This also means that we have $h+1$ levels, $h$ of which contain internal nodes, so that summing the maximal number of internal nodes yields: $n_I\\le \\sum_{i=0}^{h-1}2^i=2^{h}-1$.\n",
    "4) The inequality $h \\le n-1$ follows from (1). For the lower bound, we rearrange the upper-bound of (1) to get:\n",
    "$$\\log(n+1)\\le \\frac{\\log(n+1)}{\\log 2}\\le h+1.$$\n",
    "5) The upper-bound is similar to (1). For the lower bound, instead of having at least one node in each of the $h$ levels above the root, when $T$ is proper we must have at least $2$ nodes in each of these levels, so that $n\\ge 2h+1$\n",
    "6) In a proper binary tree $T$ of height $h$, the minimal number of leaves is achieved when each of the levels between $1$ and $h-1$ contains precisely 2 nodes, one of which is a leaf. If this is not the case, then we are necessarily adding two leaves instead of only one. This gives $2$ leaves at level $h$, plus one leaf for each other level strictly greater than $0$, from which we get $n_E\\ge h+1$. The upper-bound is proved the same way as in (2). \n",
    "7) Same proof as (3).\n",
    "8) The lower bound follows from the upper-bound of (5) again. For the upper-bound of (8), we re-arrange the lower bound of (5).\n",
    "\n",
    "QED\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark:** Beware that in [GTG13], $\\log(x):=\\ln(x)/\\ln(2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proposition 8.9:\n",
    "With the notation of the previous proposition, if $T$ is a proper binary tree then:\n",
    "$$n_E = n_I +1.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof:\n",
    "This is easy to prove by induction on the height $h$ of the tree. The cases of $h=0,1$ are trivial, so we can focus on the induction step. Suppose the statement is true for all proper binary trees having heights lower or equal to a fixed positive integer $h$. Consider now a tree $T$ of height $h+1$. In this case, we have one root and two subtrees of heights $h$ and $h'\\le h$. \n",
    "\n",
    "With $i=h, h'$, let $n^{(i)}$, $n_E^{(i)}$, and $n_I^{(i)}$ respectively denote the number of nodes, leaves and internal nodes of the subtree of height $i$. The total number of external nodes must be:\n",
    "$$n_E = n_E^{(h)}+ n_E^{(h')}=n_I^{(h)}+ n_I^{(h')}+2,$$\n",
    "and adding the root to the internal nodes of $T$, we have:\n",
    "$$n_I = n_I^{(h)}+ n_I^{(h')}+1,$$\n",
    "from which we get $n_E = n_I +1$ for a proper binary tree of height $h+1$.\n",
